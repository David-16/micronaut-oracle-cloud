Oracle Cloud Functions are based on https://fnproject.io/[Project.fn]. You can write simple functions targeting the Oracle Cloud Function environment by extending from the api:oci.function.OciFunction[] super class.

This super class enables dependency injection for the function. Note that the the function definition must conform to the following rules:

* The class must have a public no arguments constructor
* A public method that executes the function must be defined
* The class must be annotated with `@Singleton`

The following provides an example that uses the Object Storage API to list the available buckets:

snippet::example.ListBucketsFunction[project-base="docs-examples/example-function", source="main", tags="imports,class"]

<1> A public class with a no argument constructor annotated with `@Singleton` and extending from api:oci.function.OciFunction[]
<2> You can use the `@Inject` annotation to inject SDK components

Once you have correctly defined the function you should define a public method that is the function handler. For example:

snippet::example.ListBucketsFunction[project-base="docs-examples/example-function", source="main", tags="method", indent="0"]

The above example uses the Object Storage API to list the available buckets.
